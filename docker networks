‚úÖ 5. Docker Networks

  
üìò Definition:
    A Docker Network allows communication between containers, and optionally between containers and the host machine. 
    It defines how containers find and talk to each other.

üîπ Why Use Docker Networks?
    To enable isolated communication between services (e.g., web ‚Üî database).
    Avoid exposing internal services to the outside world.
    Allow scaling and load-balancing in Docker Compose or Swarm.

üß™ Common Commands:

| **Type**                 | **Description**                                                                             |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **bridge (default)**     | Creates an internal private network on the host. Most common for single-host communication. |
| **host**                 | Container shares the host‚Äôs network namespace. No isolation.                                |
| **none**                 | No network interface at all.                                                                |
| **overlay (Swarm only)** | Enables multi-host communication across a Docker Swarm cluster.                             |
| **custom bridge**        | User-defined bridge network allowing container name-based DNS resolution.                   |

| Action                            | Command                                           |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| List networks                     | `docker network ls`                               |
| Create network                    | `docker network create <name>`                    |
| Connect container to network      | `docker network connect <network> <container>`    |
| Disconnect container from network | `docker network disconnect <network> <container>` |
| Remove network                    | `docker network rm <name>`                        |


EXAMPLE:

          docker network ls                            # List all networks
          docker network create mynet                  # Create a custom bridge network
          docker network inspect mynet                 # View details
          docker network rm mynet                      # Delete network


üõ†Ô∏è Attaching a Container to a Network:

    docker run --network=mynet --name myapp helloimage
    Containers on the same custom network can reach each other by name.
    myapp can ping db (if there‚Äôs another container named db) using:
      ping db

üîÑ Default vs Custom Bridge:
    1.Default bridge does not support name-based DNS (must use IP).
    2.Custom bridge does support name resolution (use container names).
