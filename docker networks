✅ 5. Docker Networks

  
📘 Definition:
    A Docker Network allows communication between containers, and optionally between containers and the host machine. 
    It defines how containers find and talk to each other.

🔹 Why Use Docker Networks?
    To enable isolated communication between services (e.g., web ↔ database).
    Avoid exposing internal services to the outside world.
    Allow scaling and load-balancing in Docker Compose or Swarm.

🔗 Types of Docker Networks:
          Type	                    Description
          bridge (default)	        Creates an internal private network on the host. Most common for single-host communication.
          host	                    Container shares the host’s network namespace. No isolation.
          none	                    No network interface at all.
          overlay (Swarm only)	    For multi-host communication.
          custom bridge	            User-defined bridge, allows container name-based DNS resolution.

🧪 Common Commands:
          
          docker network ls                            # List all networks
          docker network create mynet                  # Create a custom bridge network
          docker network inspect mynet                 # View details
          docker network rm mynet                      # Delete network


🛠️ Attaching a Container to a Network:

    docker run --network=mynet --name myapp helloimage
    Containers on the same custom network can reach each other by name.
    myapp can ping db (if there’s another container named db) using:
      ping db

🔄 Default vs Custom Bridge:
    1.Default bridge does not support name-based DNS (must use IP).
    2.Custom bridge does support name resolution (use container names).
